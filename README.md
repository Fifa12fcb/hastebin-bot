# hastebin-bot

This is my first public project in a while.

I needed a system like this for a ticket bot I was working on and though why not make it a public repo for everyone.

Ik there is one out there already, but this one is a little more "advanced"

Config:

There is a ``config.json`` file, fill out the information in there and you're good to go.

Usage:

(prefix)haste (what you want to post)

examples:

!haste ``this is a test``
This would return a link to your given paste site with the information text "this is a test"

!haste ``./test.txt``
This would get the content from the file test.txt and paste it to the given website.
